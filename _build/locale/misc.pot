msgid "Django promises API stability and forwards-compatibility since version 1.0. In a nutshell, this means that code you develop against a version of Django will continue to work with future releases. You may need to make minor changes when upgrading the version of Django your project uses: see the \"Backwards incompatible changes\" section of the :doc:`release note </releases/index>` for the version or versions to which you are upgrading."

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:187
msgid "Technically, ``foo.com/bar`` and ``foo.com/bar/`` are two different URLs, and search-engine robots (and some Web traffic-analyzing tools) would treat them as separate pages. Django should make an effort to \"normalize\" URLs so that search-engine robots don't get confused."

msgid "Discourage redundancy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:209

msgid "XML should not be used for template languages"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:234
msgid "Assume designer competence"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:236
msgid "The template system shouldn't be designed so that templates necessarily are displayed nicely in WYSIWYG editors such as Dreamweaver. That is too severe of a limitation and wouldn't allow the syntax to be as nice as it is. Django expects template authors are comfortable editing HTML directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:242
msgid "Treat whitespace obviously"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:244
msgid "The template system shouldn't do magic things with whitespace. If a template includes whitespace, the system should treat the whitespace as it treats text -- just display it. Any whitespace that's not in a template tag should be displayed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:250
msgid "Don't invent a programming language"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:252
msgid "The goal is not to invent a programming language. The goal is to offer just enough programming-esque functionality, such as branching and looping, that is essential for making presentation-related decisions. The :ref:`Django Template Language (DTL) <template-language-intro>` aims to avoid advanced logic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:257

msgid "Safety and security"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:264
msgid "The template system, out of the box, should forbid the inclusion of malicious code -- such as commands that delete database records."

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:287
msgid "Use request objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/design-philosophies.txt:289
msgid "Views should have access to a request object -- an object that stores metadata about the current request. The object should be passed directly to a view function, rather than the view function having to access the request data from a global variable. This makes it light, clean and easy to test views by passing in \"fake\" request objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Differentiate between GET and POST"
